## Introduction
This is an ionic app that runs on Safari for iOS7 and Chrome 36+. The backend is a 
MongoDB database served by [mongolab](https://mongolab.com/). The DB is controlled by the [Node.js MongoDB Driver](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/node-js/). The Web Audio API is used to generate sounds without using recorded samples. While it can be built down to a web site for testing purposes, it's expected to be run on a moble device. 

## Wiki
The [Wiki](https://github.com/gMajr/gMajorMobile/wiki) contains information about the structure and usage of the app.

## Database Setup
Currently the mongodb connection URI is hardcoded into the file `db/db.js`. The 
mongolab account associated with this server belongs to one of the original
project owners. You will need to [create a mongolab account](https://mongolab.com/signup/) to obtain a new mongo server URI. 

## Local Setup
1. `sudo npm install -g bower`
1. `npm install`
1. `bower install`
1. `npm install -g ionic`
1. `gulp` (concatenates js files, serves the app at localhost:8080, watches for file changes and recompiles them and restarts server as needed)

## Deployment Setup
See [Azure Deployment](https://github.com/gMajr/gMajorMobile/wiki/Azure-Deployment)


## Requirements

- Ionic 1.0.0-beta.9 "gadolinium-gator" for mobile framework
- Apple xcode for iOS building / testing
- Gulp

## Development

### Installing Dependencies

To build / test for iOS you need a Macintosh computer.
Install XCode from the Apple app store here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12

To build / test with Android you need the Android SDK available here:
http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
(I recommend installing the link for the stand-alone SDK rather than the one bundled with Eclipse)

To build and test in a web browser:
`gulp serve-ionic`

To build and test on iOS:
`ionic emulate iOS`

To build and test on Andriod:
`ionic emulate android`
